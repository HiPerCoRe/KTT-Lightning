KTT Lightning
=============
KTT Lightning is a library which provides collection of generic templated algorithms such as reduction, similar in functionality
to Nvidia Thrust. The library internally uses KTT framework for transparent auto-tuning which improves algorithm performance without
a need for user to manually define tuning parameters. Currently, the only supported API is Nvidia CUDA. The library is in early
development stage.
